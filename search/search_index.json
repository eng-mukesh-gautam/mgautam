In this collaborative appointment, I am working on developing solutions for resilience enhancement of cyber-physical energy systems. Graduate Research Assistant (August 2019 - present) As a graduate research assistant at University of Nevada, Reno, I have worked on following funded projects. National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project: \" Reliability and Resilience Assurance of Cyber-physical Energy Systems \". The main objectives of this project are to (1) develop methods to model propagations of failures and attacks through system layers; and (2) determine key factors and establish algorithmic solutions that help prevent future power grids from catastrophic failures. US Department of Energy (DOE) funded project: \"Optimization of Excess Solar and Storage Capacity for Grid Services\". The main objectives of this project are to (1) advance the utilization of PV and ES smart inverter (SI) control for use in a defined set of grid services that will be developed as a suite of software applications aggregating a distributed DER learning agents; (2) develop and demonstrate a grid-edge energy storage-as-a-service (ESaaS) solution that increases the adoption of BTM PV by increasing the affordability of storage; and (3) co-optimize aggregated grid services provided by BTM PV, BTM PV plus ES, ESaaS, and DER assets. US Department of Energy (DOE) funded project: \"Quantifying the resilience value of solar plus storage value for City of Reno\". The main objective of this project is to develop a valuation methodology to quantify the value of resilience provided by solar-plus-storage systems, considering operational cost savings, avoided costs, emergency response, and other public benefits. Graduate Teaching Assistant (January 2020 - May 2020 and January 2022 - May 2022) As a graduate teaching assistant at University of Nevada, Reno, I assisted the course instructor in teaching of Electric Circuits (EE 220) course via grading homeworks and exams, conducting recitation classes, etc. Electrical Engineer (August 2015 - July 2019) As an electrical engineer at Budhi Ganga Hydropower Project (BHP) under Department of Electricity Development in Nepal, I was involved in the following tasks. Design of electro-mechanical components of BHP. Design of 132 kV double circuit 50-mile transmission line for evacuating power generated from BHP. Project Admistrative Tasks: I served as Procurement Officer and a member of Evaluation Committee at BHP. Lecturer (November 2013 - August 2015) As a lecturer at Kathmandu Engineering College affiliated with Tribhuvan University in Nepal, I was involved in teaching various courses including Electric Ciruits, Electric Machines, Power Systems, Control Systems, etc.","title":"Work Experience"},{"location":"projects/#nsf-funded-collaborative-researcher-june-2022-present","text":"I am working as a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Collaborative Researcher at National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
